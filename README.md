This is a collection of cute stylized low-poly game assets, perfect for building a cozy kitchen in your game. The set contains various countertops, a stove, a large fridge, floors/walls/doors, and plenty of decoration pieces to give life to your little kitchen. These assets are ideal for creating a little cooking game or designing a small kitchen scene for a life-simulation game.

### Features

- **34+ Stylised low-poly 3D models,** perfect for games across all platforms, including mobile.
- **Textured** using a single gradient atlas texture (1024x1024) that can be downsampled up to 128x128 for further optimization.
- Models are included as **.OBJ, .FBX** and **.GLTF,** That means the files work in most 3D game engines (including **Unity, Godot, Unreal Engine, Roblox,** and more)
- **Free for personal and commercial use,** no attribution required. (CC0 Licensed)
